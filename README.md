We encountered multiple challenges throughout the development process, especially during the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) to power FinIQ's AI capabilities. Some of the LLMs used include:
- **Gemma 2B**
- **Mistral 7B**
- **Llama 3.2**

Despite constraints like limited TPU access and dataset size, we worked extensively over 24 hours to refine the AI functionalities, though some limitations persisted.
